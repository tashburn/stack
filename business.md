# Advice
- “If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.”
- The Dilbert principle: Be in the top 25% in two things (too hard to be the best in 1 thing)
- “WHAT INTERESTING THING ARE YOU WORKING ON? WHY IS THAT INTERESTING TO YOU? WHAT’S SURPRISING ABOUT THAT? IS ANYBODY ELSE THINKING ABOUT THIS?”
- “who are good at one are terrible at the other.
- When I ask him about either, he often asks me variants of the following questions:
  - “Do you understand it?”
  - “Do you think they’ll be dominant and growing 3 years from now?”
  - “Do you think this technology will be more or less a part of our lives in 3 years?”
  - He’s made dozens of spectacular investments based on his own answers to these questions, plus an added dimension: emotional response. One might dismiss talk of “gut” with a wave of the hand, but, as they say, “once you’re lucky, twice you’re good.” Kevin has replicated his success over and over again”

- culture: Entrepreneur Cindy Gallop on how to build a successful business: “There is a formula for success in business, and it goes like this: You set out to find the very best talent in the marketplace, and then give them a compelling and inspirational vision of what you want them to achieve for you and the company. Then you empower them to achieve those goals using their own skills and talents in any way they choose. If, at the same time, you demonstrate how enormously you value them, not just through compensation, but also verbally, every single day, and if you enable that talent to share in the profit that they help create for you, you’ll be successful. It’s so simple, and virtually nobody does it, because it requires a high-trust working environment, and most business environments are low-trust. In order to own the future of your business, you have to design it around trust.” Source: The Most Provocative Woman in the World: Cindy Gallop



# Hiring
- How to interview someone: “Lesson number one, when people ask me what [interviewing] tips would I give, is aim for the heart, not the head. Once you get the heart, you can go to the head. Once you get the heart and the head, then you’ll have a pathway to the soul.”

  - https://medium.com/@cvitullo/questions-to-ask-your-interviewer-82a26e67ce6c
- Crockford: I’m looking for quality of presentation. I want to see what he thinks is something he’s proud of. I want to see evidence that in fact he is the author of the thing that he’s defending. I find that is much more effective than asking them to solve puzzles or trivia questions. I see all that kind of stuff as useless. But how effectively they can communicate, that’s a skill that I’m hiring for.

- https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-with-gmail-creator-and-y-combinator-partner-paul-buchheit
- Ask hard questions and see if they give direct, insightful answers, or if they're evasive and dismissive. It also helps if there is a product you can try. I would avoid startups that have a ton of hype and no product.

# Finding Cofounder
- http://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/grow-the-puzzle-around-you
- Jessica: When it came to investing, I had something that my cofounders didn’t have: I was the Social Radar. I couldn’t judge our applicants’ technical ability, or even most of the ideas. My cofounders were experts at those things.  I looked at qualities of the applicants my cofounders couldn't see.  Did they seem earnest? Were they determined? Were they flexible-minded?  And most importantly, what was the relationship between the cofounders like? While my partners discussed the idea with the applicants, I usually sat observing silently. Afterward, they would turn to me and ask, "Should we fund them?"
From the beginning I was careful about only funding earnest people. Back then, I never envisioned the people we funded growing into a community of thousands of YC alumni, but I always tried to create an asshole-free culture. If I could tell someone was a conceited asshole, we didn’t fund them. I’m sure we’ve since funded some conceited assholes, but early on I was pretty rigid about this. And I think it’s the basis of the culture of our alumni community.
